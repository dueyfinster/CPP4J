# Introduction to C++

## Lab2 - Functions


1.  Write a program that asks the user to enter a number, and then prints out the multiplication table for that number, for example:
```
1 * 3 = 3
2 * 3 = 6
...
12 * 3 = 36
```
Implement the output of the multiplication table using a function.

2. Write a function that converts a temperature from degrees Celsius to degrees Fahrenheit. You can find the formula for this on various web pages, for example [here](https://www.manuelsweb.com/temp.htm).
Now write another program to covert back from Fahrenheit to Celsius.

Write a program that exercises these functions

3. Write a program that asks the user to enter 2 integers. Now write a loop that asks the user to enter a single character command representing an arithmetic operation to apply to the two integers, and display the result each time. Use the following
   * `'a'` for add
   * `'s'` for subtract
   * `'m'` for multiply
   * `'d'` for divide
   
Implement the arithmetic components as functions.
