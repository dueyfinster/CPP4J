## Lab 5 - Classes and Objects

1. Define a class to represent a date.

Provide a constructor that requires a day, month and year. However you can choose how you represent the date internally.

Include some static data to represent, for each month of the year, how many days are in the month. Don't worry about leap years for now.

Add a function member that checks if the date is valid (ie valid month number, correct number of days for the month, etc). 
Don't worry about validating the arguments to the constructor for now (how would you report this error and what remedial action would you take?)
We will discuss this later...
