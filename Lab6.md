# Introduction to C++

## Lab 6 - Operators

1. See if you can improve the implementation of the Fraction class shown in the slides. Add operators to perform subtraction and 
multiplication as well as addition.

Add a conversion operator to transform the state of the Fraction into a string (the equivalent of the Java toString() method).

2. See if you can add operators to the Date class to add or subtract a number of days from the Date, 
taking care to ensure that the month and perhaps year are updated accordingly.

Add methods to provide simple functionality such as "tomorrow" and "yesterday".
