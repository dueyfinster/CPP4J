# Introduction to C++

## Lab 1 - Getting Started

1. Write a C++ program that simply prints out your name. Use this exercise to familiarise yourself with the development tools and environment

1. Write a program that asks the user to enter 5 integer values. Display the following
   * the largest of the numbers entered
   * the smallest of the numbers entered
   * the sum of the values
   * the average value
   
1. Use the following code segment to generate a random number in the range 0 to 99:
```
int rand = rand() % 100
```
Ask the user to guess the number, on each guess display a message to say if their guess is
   * correct
   * too high
   * too low
Repeat until the number is correctly guessed
